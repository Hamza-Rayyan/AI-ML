^Loan Prediction:
> Analysing the data_set of a bank of about 614 records and futher predicting the pattern of customer behavior.
> Taking insights using various pre-processing stages and data visualization.
> Data_cleaning so as to make data ready to be trained.
> As the last stages training and testing data_sets.
> We apply the splitted data_set to a suitable ML-Algorithm, In this case we will be using LogisticRegression.
> Lastly measure the accuracy of prediction.

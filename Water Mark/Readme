>>> Objective: To add a WaterMarks to images.
>>> Importing libraries.
  -cv2 for image processing.

>>> Importing Logo image.
>>> Analys the shape of the images in height and width.
>>> Add the path to reference variable of the image folder Ex:("images/*.*")
// "*.*" this can be used as an extension for accepting all tyoes of files.
>>> Now we just run a for loop inside the folder of images, it select each image one by one and calculates the image height/width and add the logo at 
the priscribed positions.

>>> Now we calculate the center of the image by dividing the pixels of height and width into half also the logo image.
>>> We have take all four parameters and stored it in a variable called roi.
>>> With roi and some other parameters such logo,size,colour 
    - cv2.addWeighted(roi,1,logo,0.3,0)
>>> store all these in result variable and later will apply it to the image.
>>> Lastly will add the to the output folder.
// here the images are open but the the input and output images should in folders.

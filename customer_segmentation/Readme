Customer Segmentation.

>>> Objective: To segment the customer into the particular segment.
>>>Importing the respective libraries.
	-Numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn.
	-From sklearn package
		- train_test_split,LogisticRegression,accuracy_score.
>>> Importing Row data_set.
>>> Data Visualization level 1.
- Analys the data_set by viewing data "shape()","head()" and columns list or "feilds".

-we treat our data as df.
-Understanding our output data_set.
-df['Segmentation'].Value_Counts()
-df.describe(): this gives the data mean,median,avg.
-As we found data_output is segmented in four segment
D = 2268
A = 1972
C = 1970
B = 1858
-By looking at the output we can consider the data is balanced.
// if the data_sets are imbalanced than the prediction would be wrong.
- we may delete the useless parameters using del.
-In our case we have "var","Id" as useless.
-It would be helpful for the alg to provide less but useful.
-view the empty data df.isnull().sum()
-drop the data set which are empty.
// Not every time we drop the empty data, could apply some analysis process.
-Now we have left with clean data.
-Pre-processing stage level-1 done.
>>>Data visualization level 2.
- Now time to have some graphical viewpoint understand our data against different parameters.
- Converting the catogerical data into numerical values as it is more suitable to the ML-alg.
-pre-processing stage, Data visualization level-2 done.
>>>Splitting the data_set into train and testing data.
- we created four parts of our data 80 percent into train which have two parts.
	train_x as input
	train_y as output
- we have set 20 percent of data is testing
	test_x as input
	test_y as output
- Also we take 10 output data as a final_test to test against our alg accuracy.
- we import different alg and store it into reference variable.
- In our case we have LogisticRegression,svm,KKN.
- By testing our predicted final_test and the alg we can see the accuracy of the models.
>>> Our final test random outputs.
